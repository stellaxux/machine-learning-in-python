# Python Machine Learning

This is a place for me to practice coding in python and experiment with Sebastian Raschka's book -- [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1437754343&sr=8-2&keywords=python+machine+learning+essentials). Codes in here might be from the [author's repository](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning) or modified by myself.
